# Wave Interference Simulation   

A **C++** project for our Computer Graphics course, simulating wave interference on a 3D water surface using **SFML** and **ImGUI**.  

## Requirements  

Below is a list of tasks we had to fulfill for this project:

### Basic  
- Frame-by-frame animation 
- Save single animation frames to a file (Windows: also copy to clipboard)  

### Extended  
- Rotate the water surface before starting the animation  
- Smooth animation  
- Option to print single frames  

Our implementation covers all the required tasks.

## Tech Stack  
- **C++**, **SFML**, **ImGUI**
